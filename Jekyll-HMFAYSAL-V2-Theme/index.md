Our lab focuses on biomedical image computing, computer vision and machine learning related research, especially through deep learning approaches. The ongoing projects include patient classification through neuroimages (MRI, fMRI, CT and PET), anatomical segmentation and registration, brain connectivity analysis, motion analysis and tracking, shape modeling and distance metric learning. We have particularly strong interests in developing novel feature extraction, machine learning and deep learning solutions to improve the understanding and diagnoses of various neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's Disease, Autism, stroke and Parkinson's Disease.
