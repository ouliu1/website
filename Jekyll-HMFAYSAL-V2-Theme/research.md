### Medical Image Computing (MIC)

The major research goal of MIC is to extract clinically relevant information or knowledge from medical images. We have expertise and strong interests in applying advanced machine learning, deep learning, shape modeling, spectral graph theory, etc, to study anatomical structures of human organs, and analyze brain connectivity patterns in various population groups.
